# Masters of Shaolin

An imageboard where afficionados of Shaolin Kung Fu can upload images, along with a title and a description, of their adored masters and discuss their uploads in a comment section. I built the network in an intense one-week project while attending a full-time coding bootcamp with SPICED Academy, Berlin, from Sept 2021 to Dec 2021.

### Development

The **client-side** is built as a single-page application (SAP) with _Vue_. I utilise the _Browser History API_ to change the url shown in the location bar of the browser whenever the user changes what is displayed.

The **server-side** is built with _Express_ and _Node_. I use the _Multer_ middleware to handle multipart image-data upload. _Uid-safe_ allows me to generate unique names for uploading the images. I use _AWS S3_ as a reliable, centralised and permanent storage solution for the images.

### Security

Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks are averted by setting an 2MB limit for image-upload. I added a _X-Frame-Options_ HTTP response header to prevent attempts at clickjacking.
