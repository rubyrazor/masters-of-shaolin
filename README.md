### Development

The **client-side** is built as a single-page application (SAP) with _Vue.js_. I use the _Browser History API_ to change the url shown in the location bar of the browser whenever the user changes what is displayed.

The **server-side** is built with _Express_ which is hosted in a _Node.js_ runtime environment. I use the _Multer_ middleware to handle multipart image-data upload. _Uid-safe_ allows me to generate unique names for uploading the images and _AWS S3_ as a reliable, centralised and permanent storage solution for the images.

### Security
Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks are averted by setting an 2MB limit for image-upload.
